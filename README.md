# Diversely
An app to track the diversity of the books you read based on the author's race, gender, sexual orientation, and country of origin.

## Motivation
Reading is an opportunity to
* increase empathy for people who are different from you
* see yourself reflected (positively) in the world
* vicariously live a life you canâ€™t experience </br>

But I was wasting that opportunity.

Here were the books I had read in the past four months: </br>

So I decided to create an app that would help me track what I was reading in order to seek out texts that would broaden my understanding of the world.

## Demo

## Tech
Built with:
* Rails
* HTML
* CSS

## Installation
* Clone the repo
* In Terminal, cd into the directory

To run the app:
* In the directory, start the server: `rails s`
* Open the webpage, most likely at `http://localhost:3000/`

## Future
This was the second project I coded from conception, and the first I made on my own. I'm very aware of its flaws, but I'm pleased at the product I was able to create after studying for five weeks.

I would love to revise this as a full-fledged app with a proper book API and wiki-style confirmation for author's demographic information. Next steps would be to add data about the books' characters.
